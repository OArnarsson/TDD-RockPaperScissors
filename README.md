### About the project
This small RockPaperScissors game was made to get some practice on both front-end back-end development.
The game is constructed like so:
The computer is rolling between all possible actions.  
When the player locks in his action, the computer slows down the roll, eventually locking in an action.
Player action vs Computer action is compared and corresponding result is displayed.
